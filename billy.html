            <br><br>
            <p>Billy Hargrove (portrayed by Dacre Montgomery) is careless, rash, and verbally abusive to his stepsister Max â€“
            a consequence of the physical abuse he himself suffers from his very abusive father.[12] He is rather promiscuous, often
            sleeping with bored housewives. In Season 3, he becomes the unwilling catalyst for the Mind Flayer. Flashbacks reveal that
            Billy had a close and loving relationship with his mother but she left when he was young due to his father's abuse, explaining his comfort around older women. Eleven later reminds Billy of his mother, allowing him to break free from the possession, and sacrifice himself to save Eleven from the Mind Flayer.<p/>
