            <h1>Summary of Season Two </h1>
            
            <h2>Beware of Spoilers</h2>
            <br>
            <h4>With season three arriving on Netflix on Thursday the 4th of July, here’s a refresher on all the important stuff from last time around: the monsters, the special powers, the government conspiracies<br>
            and most crucially,  Steves hair. <br>
            <br> 
            Almost exactly a year. Season two starts around Halloween 1984, close to the one year anniversary of Will’s disappearance. In that time, Will’s classmates have given him the unflattering nickname<br>
            “zombie boy”. He has episodes in which he freezes and sees a long-limbed shadowy monster looming over the town. In one such episode, the monster sticks a tentacle down Will’s throat and infects him<br>
            like a parasite, gradually taking control of his mind and using him as its puppet. <br>
            <br>
            After killing the Demogorgon, Eleven hid in the woods, where she was discovered by a hunter against whom she used her powers and stole his warm jacket. Later,<br>
            she took supplies from another home, again using her powers. The crimes were reported to Police Chief Hopper, who realised Eleven had survived, and lured her into the open<br>
            by leaving out her favourite snack - Eggos. Eventually, Hopper moved Eleven into his grandfather’s old hunting cabin in the woods, keeping her fed and safe from the government agents<br>
            looking for her, and keeping her existence a secret from the others.<br>
            
            <br>
            But truely there really is so much to unpack in season two so you may be better of just watching the whole show again.
