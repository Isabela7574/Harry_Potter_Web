            <h1>Demogorgon</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>Demogorgon is a deity or demon, associated with the underworld
            and envisaged as a powerful primordial being, whose very name had
            been taboo. Although often ascribed to Greek mythology, the name
            probably arises from an unknown copyist's misreading of a commentary
            by a fourth-century scholar, Lactantius Placidus. The concept itself
            though can be traced back to the original misread term demiurge.<p/>
