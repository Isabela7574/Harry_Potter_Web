            <h1>Joyce</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>Joyce Byers (portrayed by Winona Ryder[6]) is the mother of
            Will and Jonathan Byers and is divorced from Lonnie Byers, the
            father of her two children. Joyce is a very caring and strong-willed
            woman who works as a retail clerk at Melvald's General Store in
            downtown Hawkins. She was born and raised in Hawkins and she attended
            Hawkins High School with the future chief of police, Jim Hopper, and
            her Season Two love interest, Bob Newby. In Season Three, she is planning
            to sell her house and move out of Hawkins, much to the dismay of Hopper who
            tries to convince her to go on a date with him. Joyce is more interested in
            figuring out why the magnets in her house keep failing (to the extent that
            she does not show up to the date that they had planned together) and while
            investigating the reason behind this, she and Hopper uncover a Russian conspiracy.
            After infiltrating a Russian lab beneath the new Starcourt Mall, where the Russians
            have opened another portal into the Upside Down, Joyce is forced to close the portal
            by turning off the Russian machine used to open it with Hopper in the room,
            causing his apparent death. She then takes guardianship of Eleven and moves
            with her and her two sons out of Hawkins three months later.<p/>
